  <p>
		We had to cut the trace on the PCB in this class and read from the hshbme280. Unfortunately, not all of the addresses were recognized from my sensors when I tested with "sudo i2cdetect -y 1".
		My PCF8591 YL-40 did not recognize any address. DS3231 recognized 57 and UU at 68. BME280 recognized 77.
		<h3>Layout of the build video</h3>
		In my 30 second build video I will feature all the parts I acquired to build this project, a time lapse of the process of building this project, and the testing/results.
		The introduction will feature me unboxing all my parts along with a voiceover of the part’s name. 
		I will also display the part’s name so it can be read.
		After showcasing the parts, the video will transition to a 15-20 second time lapse of the whole build process.
		Depending on time I will hover and explain the connection or take pictures.
		Finally, I will run the code and show the sensor picking up data based on heat temperature from the 8 pixels.
		Throughout the video I might play light instrumental music to make it an intriguing/entertaining 30 seconds.

  <H3>Week 7 Hardware (Friday Dec. 1)</H3>
  <p>
	In this class I tested my StudentSenseHat and ran traffic2B.c and ghmain. The results I saw when I ran traffic2B.c was the LED would blink green, fades (turns off), and then blink red. <br>As shown: </br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-liang/HeatSeek/master/images/StudentSenseHat.JPG"> </img>
	This program repeats until it is exited. Additionally, when I ran ghmain the StudentSenseHat would read input from the sensors giving feedback on the temperature and light. <br> As shown: <br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-liang/HeatSeek/master/images/traffic2B.JPG"> </img> 
	Finally, I setted up the RTC clock as it was initially preset to year 2000. <br> As shown: </br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-liang/HeatSeek/master/images/hwclock.JPG"></img>

 <H3>Week 6 Hardware (Friday Oct. 16 - Nov. 24)</H3>
  <p>
    During this period the school was on strike. This is what I've accomplished in the last 5 weeks.
	<ul>
		<li>I finished soldering the StudentSenseHat and picked up the remaining modules needed to connect to the SenseHat.</li>
		<li> Started filming the build video where I unboxed all my parts and imaged the Rasperry Pi.</li>
		<li> Enable the I2C bus on Raspberry Pi so it can communicate with GPio pins. </li>
		<li>Connected the Thermal Array Sensor to Arduino and need to purchase logic level controller in order to step down 5V signals to 3.3V.
			The reason is because the sensor sends 5V signal while the GPio pin are capped at 3.3V.
			I used the following diagram as reference for my connections.</li>
			<li>Ordered SparkFun logic level converter - Bi directional on November 9, 2017 and received on November 20, 2017. Fulfilled by Elmwood Electronics.</li>
	</ul>

  <br>Arduino Testing Result:</br>
  <br>The following shows a series of results from the Thermal Array Sensor. The numbers represent each of the eight temperature pixels.</br>

  <H3>Week 2 Hardware (Friday Sept. 15)</H3>
  <p>
  Completed and submitted project proposal. For my project I will use this link for research https://alexdglover.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/arduino-project-1-heat-seeking-robot-part-1/ 
  I intend to build a heat seeking mechanism that tracks high temperature output. For example the human body.
  <br>Parts Requirement:</br>
  <ul>
	<li>Raspberry Pi 3</li>
	<li>TPA81 Devantech 8 Pixel Thermal Array Sensor</li>
	<li>2x 1.8K ohms resistors</li>
