  <h4>Correct web template usage</h4>
	<p>
	Building this project will require time and commitment and I believe the best way to keep track of this progress is to write it to a blog. 
	In other words, to set up a website and using GitHub to host it. 
	A web template can be retrieved from https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat. 
	We cloned this repository and edited indexcontent.html 
	</p>
	
  <h4>Introduction using a system diagram</h4>
	<p>
	This schematic diagram will help assist in replicating HeatSeek. 
	The purpose of this project is to detect and output heat temperature read from the sensor. 
	This sensor retrieves data by running a C program stored inside the Raspberry Pi. 
	</p>

  <h4>Bill of Materials/Budget</h4>
	<p>
	The total budget to replicate this project will cost approximately $222.18. 
	However, I had a breadboard and jumper wires. 
	If not, the total budget to replicate this project will cost approximately $242.16. 
	The project consists of a Raspberry Pi 3, a Thermal Array Sensor, a Bi-Directional Logic Converter, and a breadboard. 
	Below you will find the cost of each item and a link to where they can be purchased. 
	
	Raspberry Pi 3, $112.99 CAD - <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B01CCF6V3A/ref=sr_1_5?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1516324581&sr=1-5&keywords=Raspberry+Pi+3"> https://www.amazon.ca/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B01CCF6V3A/ref=sr_1_5?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1516324581&sr=1-5&keywords=Raspberry+Pi+3 </a>
	Devantech Pixel 8 Thermal Array Sensor, $101.86 CAD - <a href="https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/devantech-8-pixel-thermal-array-sensor.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvLLSyu3i2AIV3brACh11QQTWEAYYASABEgIrhPD_BwE"> https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/devantech-8-pixel-thermal-array-sensor.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvLLSyu3i2AIV3brACh11QQTWEAYYASABEgIrhPD_BwE </a>
	Bi-Directional Logic Converter, $7.33 CAD - <a href="https://elmwoodelectronics.ca/products/12009"> https://elmwoodelectronics.ca/products/12009 </a>
	Breadboard, $5.99 - <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/OSEPP-Breadboard-400-Points-Components-LS-00018/dp/B00EFZV2CG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1516329412&sr=8-5&keywords=breadboard"> https://www.amazon.ca/OSEPP-Breadboard-400-Points-Components-LS-00018/dp/B00EFZV2CG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1516329412&sr=8-5&keywords=breadboard </a>
	Jumper Wires, $13.99 - <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Foxnovo-Multicolored-40-pin-Female-Breadboard/dp/B00NPZO7CY/ref=sr_1_29?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1516329536&sr=1-29&keywords=jumper+wires"> https://www.amazon.ca/Foxnovo-Multicolored-40-pin-Female-Breadboard/dp/B00NPZO7CY/ref=sr_1_29?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1516329536&sr=1-29&keywords=jumper+wires </a>
	</p>
	
  <h4> Time Commitment </h4>
	<p>
	This project can be completed fairly quickly if the schematic diagram is followed. 
	I would approximate 3 hours daily for 3-4 days should be required. 
	Throughout this project, soldering, connecting wires, and testing the code will be needed to test if the sensor successfully reads data. 
	At the end of the project the thermal array sensor will be able to sense ambient temperature and read temperature of an object. 
	</p>
	
  <h4> Mechanical Assembly </h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Firstly, the Bi-Directional Logic Converter needs to be solder with parallel pins so it can be plugged into the breadboard.</li>
		<li>Once that is finished plug the logic converter and thermal array sensor to the breadboard.</li>
		<li>Using jumper wires connect the 5V PWR and GND to HV (Higher Levels Voltage) located in the top middle of the logic converter.</li>
		<li>Also, connect the 5V and GND from the thermal array sensor to the Raspberry Pi similar to the schematic diagram.</li>
		<li>Correspondingly you must connect LV (Lower Levels Voltage) to 3.3V and GND to the Raspberry Pi. The purpose of this is to translate a 5V device to 3.3V in order to be used with the Raspberry Pi and avoid any damages.  </li>
		<li>SDA on the sensor is connected to HV2 and LV2 is connected to the I2C SDA on the Pi.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile SCL on the sensor is connected to HV1 and LV1 is connected to I2C SCL on the Pi.</li>
		<li>The purpose of connecting to HV2 and HV1 is to translate these higher level pins on the sensor to a lower level pin on the Pi. This is to avoid any damages to the Pi as the GPIO pins are capped to 3.3V.</li>
	</ol>
	
  <h4>Soldering</h4>
	<p>
	This project requires to solder parallel pins to the Bi-Directional logic converter.
	The purpose of this is because we want a solid connection and not risk the wires loosening. 
	If the pins were not solder to the logic converter then there’s a high risk of damaging your Pi if the wires became loose.
	</p>
	
  <h4>Power Up</h4>
	<p>
	Insert the SD card to the SD card reader from the Raspberry Pi package and ensure the NOOBS operating system is installed. 
	If not, the OS can be downloaded from the following link: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/"> https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/.  </a>
	If the OS is installed insert the SD card into the SD slot of the Raspberry Pi and plug in the power.
	The Raspberry Pi will boot up however, since this is the first boot up. 
	Users are required to set up the operating system and configure their settings. 
	An important step is to sign in to the Wi-Fi network so it can have internet connection. 
	Go to Start> Raspberry Pi configuration > Interfaces and ensure I2C is enabled. 
	</p>

  <h4>Unit Testing</h4>
	<p>
	To check if the project is connected and detecting the sensor, open a terminal and type sudo i2cdetect –y 1. 
	This command will display an output that will show address 68 at location 68. 
	68 is the address used for this specific sensor. 
	In order to test this sensor a C program needs to be created and compiled. 
	The C file can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/files/rpi_tpa81.c"> https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/files/rpi_tpa81.c. </a> 
	Save the C file as yourfilename.c and compile in the terminal using the command “gcc yourfilename.c –o yourfilename”. 
	To run the program type “./yourfilename” and the program will execute. 
	</p>
	
  <h4>Production Testing</h4>
	<p>
	Once the program has successfully ran the output will display the ambient temperature which is the temperature surrounding the environment.
	Additionally, it will also display 8 different temperatures which are the field of views read from 8 pixels in the sensor. 
	</p>

  <h4>Reproducible?</h4>
	<p>
	I believe if you follow my build instructions and schematic diagram you will be able to reproduce HeatSeek. 
	I have provided a GitHub, budget, instructions, diagram, code, and instructions on how to run the code. 
	Therefore, I believe this project can be reproduce.

  <h4>Progress Report</h4>
  <p>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
  My original project schedule is not in sync with my current schedule due to the strike. 
  However, I have been able to meet the milestones of my project. 
  Recently, I have been able to purchase the parts and film an unboxing as well as assemble my project, and test it. 
  At the beginning of December until the 14th, I was taking notes and researching on how to build my project and preparing to assemble it. 
  Before assembling my project on the Raspberry Pi, I tested with Arduino to understand the basics of the connection and observe the output results. 
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
  My sensor is now assembled on the Raspberry Pi and is able to read temperature. 
  The remaining objectives I need to complete are the making of my PowerPoint slides and build instructions. 
  The PowerPoint slides will debrief the purpose of the project, the cost to build, mechanical assembly, testing. 
  My goal is to be able to instruct future readers to reproduce the same project based on my build instructions. 
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
  During this period I was made aware that I need to purchase a Bi-Directional logic converter to convert my sensor’s voltage to read on the Pi’s GPio pins. 
  The TPA81 sensor takes a voltage of 5V and the Pi’s I2C pins take a capacity of 3.3V. 
  As a results, the Bi-Directional converter will convert the voltage and vice versa so the Raspberry Pi would not be destroyed. 
  This was a problem encountered and financial update to my project as I had to spend an additional $7.33. 
  Without the Bi-Directional converter this project would be unsuccessful as I would not be able to convert a higher voltage level to a lower one. 
  Thus, I would not able to take reading from my sensor which is why this part was extremely significant. 
  Another problem was when I finished assembling my project the Raspberry Pi did not detect the address of my I2C pin. 
  I was suggested to use an oscilloscope to check if I was getting readings. 
  However, it appears that the jumper wire had a loose connection and was able to read the address after minor modifications. 
  On December 22, demonstration day my sensor's address was unidentifiable so there was a problem with my I2C bus.
  As a results, I had to debug if it was a wiring issue, damaged wires, or damaged pins.
  The problem was resolved when I disabled the I2C and re-enabled it on the Pi.

		We had to cut the trace on the PCB in this class and read from the hshbme280. Unfortunately, not all of the addresses were recognized from my sensors when I tested with "sudo i2cdetect -y 1".
		My PCF8591 YL-40 did not recognize any address. DS3231 recognized 57 and UU at 68. BME280 recognized 77.
		<h3>Layout of the build video</h3>
		In my 30 second build video I will feature all the parts I acquired to build this project, a time lapse of the process of building this project, and the testing/results.
		The introduction will feature me unboxing all my parts along with a voiceover of the part’s name. 
		I will also display the part’s name so it can be read.
		After showcasing the parts, the video will transition to a 15-20 second time lapse of the whole build process.
		Depending on time I will hover and explain the connection or take pictures.
		Finally, I will run the code and show the sensor picking up data based on heat temperature from the 8 pixels.
		Throughout the video I might play light instrumental music to make it an intriguing/entertaining 30 seconds.

	In this class I tested my StudentSenseHat and ran traffic2B.c and ghmain. The results I saw when I ran traffic2B.c was the LED would blink green, fades (turns off), and then blink red. <br>As shown: </br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-liang/HeatSeek/master/images/StudentSenseHat.JPG"> </img>
	This program repeats until it is exited. Additionally, when I ran ghmain the StudentSenseHat would read input from the sensors giving feedback on the temperature and light. <br> As shown: <br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-liang/HeatSeek/master/images/traffic2B.JPG"> </img> 
	Finally, I setted up the RTC clock as it was initially preset to year 2000. <br> As shown: </br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-liang/HeatSeek/master/images/hwclock.JPG"></img>
