  Connected the Thermal Array Sensor to Arduino and need to purchase logic level controller in order to step down 5V signals to 3.3V.
  The reason is because the sensor sends 5V signal while the GPio pin are capped at 3.3V.
  
  <br>Connection</br>
  
  <br>Arduino Testing Result:</br>
  <br>The following shows a series of results from the Thermal Array Sensor. The numbers represent each of the eight temperature pixels.</br>

  <p>
  Completed and submitted project proposal. Using this link for research <a href="https://alexdglover.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/arduino-project-1-heat-seeking-robot-part-1/"> </a> 
  I intend to build a heat seeking mechanism that tracks high temperature output. For example the human body, as our bodies constantly emits heat.
  <br>Parts requirement </br>
  <ul>
	<li>Raspberry Pi 3</li>
	<li>TPA81 Devantech 8 Pixel Thermal Array Sensor</li>
	<li>2x 1.8K ohms resistors</li>
  </ul>
