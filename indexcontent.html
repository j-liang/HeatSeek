  <h4>Progress Report</h4>
  <p>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
  My original project schedule is not in sync with my current schedule due to the strike. 
  However, I have been able to meet the milestones of my project. 
  Recently, I have been able to purchase the parts and film an unboxing as well as assemble my project, and test it. 
  At the beginning of December until the 14th, I was taking notes and researching on how to build my project and preparing to assemble it. 
  Before assembling my project on the Raspberry Pi, I tested with Arduino to understand the basics of the connection and observe the output results. 
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 40px">
  My sensor is now assembled on the Raspberry Pi and is able to read temperature. 
  The remaining objectives I need to complete are the making of my PowerPoint slides and build instructions. 
  The PowerPoint slides will debrief the purpose of the project, the cost to build, mechanical assembly, testing. 
  My goal is to be able to instruct future readers to reproduce the same project based on my build instructions. 
  </p>

  During this period I was made aware that I need to purchase a Bi-Directional logic converter to convert my sensor’s voltage to read on the Pi’s GPio pins. 
  The TPA81 sensor takes a voltage of 5V and the Pi’s I2C pins take a capacity of 3.3V. 
  As a results, the Bi-Directional converter will convert the voltage and vice versa so the Raspberry Pi would not be destroyed. 
  This was a problem encountered and financial update to my project as I had to spend an additional $7.33. 
  Without the Bi-Directional converter this project would be unsuccessful as I would not be able to convert a higher voltage level to a lower one. 
  Thus, I would not able to take reading from my sensor which is why this part was extremely significant. 
  Another problem was when I finished assembling my project the Raspberry Pi did not detect the address of my I2C pin. 
  I was suggested to use an oscilloscope to check if I was getting readings. 
  However, it appears that the jumper wire had a loose connection and was able to read the address after minor modifications.

  <h4>Various types of projects using TPA81</h4>
  In this project the person designed a robot that can extiguish fire.

  In this one the person implemented the sensor and created a thermal camera which captures a thermal image.

		We had to cut the trace on the PCB in this class and read from the hshbme280. Unfortunately, not all of the addresses were recognized from my sensors when I tested with "sudo i2cdetect -y 1".
		My PCF8591 YL-40 did not recognize any address. DS3231 recognized 57 and UU at 68. BME280 recognized 77.
		<h3>Layout of the build video</h3>
		In my 30 second build video I will feature all the parts I acquired to build this project, a time lapse of the process of building this project, and the testing/results.
		The introduction will feature me unboxing all my parts along with a voiceover of the part’s name. 
		I will also display the part’s name so it can be read.
		After showcasing the parts, the video will transition to a 15-20 second time lapse of the whole build process.
		Depending on time I will hover and explain the connection or take pictures.
		Finally, I will run the code and show the sensor picking up data based on heat temperature from the 8 pixels.
		Throughout the video I might play light instrumental music to make it an intriguing/entertaining 30 seconds.

	In this class I tested my StudentSenseHat and ran traffic2B.c and ghmain. The results I saw when I ran traffic2B.c was the LED would blink green, fades (turns off), and then blink red. <br>As shown: </br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-liang/HeatSeek/master/images/StudentSenseHat.JPG"> </img>
	This program repeats until it is exited. Additionally, when I ran ghmain the StudentSenseHat would read input from the sensors giving feedback on the temperature and light. <br> As shown: <br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-liang/HeatSeek/master/images/traffic2B.JPG"> </img> 
	Finally, I setted up the RTC clock as it was initially preset to year 2000. <br> As shown: </br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-liang/HeatSeek/master/images/hwclock.JPG"></img>

 <H3>Week 6 Hardware (Friday Oct. 16 - Nov. 24)</H3>
  <p>
    During this period the school was on strike. This is what I've accomplished in the last 5 weeks.
	<ul>
		<li>I finished soldering the StudentSenseHat and picked up the remaining modules needed to connect to the SenseHat.</li>
		<li> Started filming the build video where I unboxed all my parts and imaged the Rasperry Pi.</li>
		<li> Enable the I2C bus on Raspberry Pi so it can communicate with GPio pins. </li>
		<li>Connected the Thermal Array Sensor to Arduino and need to purchase logic level controller in order to step down 5V signals to 3.3V.
			The reason is because the sensor sends 5V signal while the GPio pin are capped at 3.3V.
			I used the following diagram as reference for my connections.</li>
			<li>Ordered SparkFun logic level converter - Bi directional on November 9, 2017 and received on November 20, 2017. Fulfilled by Elmwood Electronics.</li>
